= Installing {product-title} on premise with the Assisted Installer

Installing {product-title} on a single node requires a discovery ISO, which the Assisted Installer (AI) can generate with the cluster name, base domain, Secure Shell (SSH) public key, and pull secret.

[id="assisted-installer-prerequisites"]
== Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* You read the documentation on xref:../../installing/installing-preparing.adoc#installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].
* If you use a firewall, you xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configured it to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.

[NOTE]
====
Be sure to also review this site list if you are configuring a proxy.

.Procedure

. On the administration node, open a browser and navigate to the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift[OpenShift Hybrid Cloud Console].

. In the *Clusters* page, click *Create cluster* and navigate to the *Datacenter* tab.

. In the *Assisted Installer* area, click *Create cluster*.

. Enter your *Cluster details*:

.. Enter a *Cluster name* for the cluster.

.. Enter a *Base domain* for the cluster. The base domain must be a valid DNS name. For example:
+
----
example.com
----
+
All DNS records must be subdomains of this base domain and include the cluster name. You cannot change the base domain after cluster installation. For example:
+
----
<cluster-name>.example.com
----

.. From the list, select the *OpenShift version* you want to install.

.. Optional: Select *Install single node OpenShift (SNO)* to install {product-title} using only one host.

.. Optional: Select *Use arm64 CPU architecture* if you want to use arm64 CPU architecture instead of the default x86_64 CPU architecture. Keep in mind, some features are not available with arm64 CPU architecture.

.. Optional: Edit the pull secret. Pull secrets are used to download {product-title} components and connect clusters to a Red Hat account.

.. Optional: To add additional protection to your data, select one or both of the following:
* *Enable encryption of installation disks on control plane nodes*
* *Enable encryption of installation disks on worker nodes*

. Click *Next*.

. In the *Host discovery* page, you generate discovery ISOs. A discovery ISO contains an installation of RHCOS and installs an agent on the host.
+
Add hosts to your cluster:

.. Click *Add hosts*.

.. In the *Add hosts* window, select one of the following:

* *Full image file*—recommended. Generate a full image of a discovery ISO and downlaod it to boot from a physical device, like a USB drive.
+
[NOTE]
====
The device you use to download the discovery ISO must be bootable.
====
* *Minimal image file*—generate a smaller image to boot with virtual media. The discovery ISO will need to download additional data during the boot. This option is useful if ISO storage capacity is limited or if it is being served over a constrained network.

.. Add the *SSH public key* of the administration node. The SSH key can provide debugging information during the installation.

.. Optional: Select *Configure cluster-wide proxy settings* if the hosts are behind a firewall that requires the use of a proxy, and define the HTTP and HTTPS proxy URLs. You can also exclude destination domain names, IP addresses, or other network CIDRs from proxying.

.. Click *Generate Discovery ISO*.

.. Download the discovery ISO and close the window.

.. Set each host to boot from the device or virtual media only once. Once the hosts are discovered, the host data appears in the table in the *Add hosts* page.

.. Optional: Select *Install Openshift Virtualization* to install the Openshift Virtualization operator and run virtual machines along containers.

.. Optional: Select *Install OpenShift Data Foundation* to install the OpenShift Data Foundation operator. This operator provides persistent software-defined storage for hybrid applications.

. Make a note of the discovery ISO URL for installing with virtual media.

[NOTE]
=====
If you enable {VirtProductName} during this process, you must have a second local storage device of at least 50GiB for your virtual machines.
