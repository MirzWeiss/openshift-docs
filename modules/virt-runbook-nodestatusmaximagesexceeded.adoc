[id="virt-runbook-NodeStatusMaxImagesExceeded"]
= NodeStatusMaxImagesExceeded

[discrete]
[id="meaning-nodestatusmaximagesexceeded"]
== Meaning

This alert fires when a node exceeds the configured maximum number of images
reported in the node status (default: 50). Once this limit is reached, the
scheduler might not be able to accurately schedule new pods because the reported
image count is wrong.

[discrete]
[id="impact-nodestatusmaximagesexceeded"]
== Impact

Pod scheduling might be imbalanced across nodes.

[discrete]
[id="diagnosis-nodestatusmaximagesexceeded"]
== Diagnosis

. Obtain the image count for the node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes <node> -o jsonpath='{range .status.images[*]}{.names}{"\n"}{end}' | wc -l
----

. If the image count is equal to the default (50) or to a configured value,
you must resolve the issue.

[discrete]
[id="mitigation-nodestatusmaximagesexceeded"]
== Mitigation

You can either increase the `nodeStatusMaxImages` value of the `KubeletConfig`
object or set its value to `-1` to disable the maximum image limit.

If you cannot resolve the issue, log in to the
link:https://access.redhat.com[Customer Portal] and open a support case,
attaching the artifacts gathered during the diagnosis procedure.
