== Deploying {sandboxed-containers-first} workloads using peer pods with the web console

You can deploy {sandboxed-containers-first} workloads from the web console. First, you must install the {sandboxed-containers-operator}, then create the `KataConfig` custom resource (CR). Once you are ready to deploy a workload in a sandboxed container, you must manually add `kata` as the `runtimeClassName` to the workload YAML file.

* The {sandboxed-containers-operator} is supported in a restricted network environment. For more information, xref:../operators/admin/olm-restricted-networks.adoc#olm-restricted-networks[Using Operator Lifecycle Manager on restricted networks].
* When using a disconnected cluster on a restricted network, you must xref:../operators/admin/olm-configuring-proxy-support.adoc#olm-configuring-proxy-support[configure proxy support in Operator Lifecycle Manager] to access the OperatorHub. Using a proxy allows the cluster to fetch the {sandboxed-containers-operator}.
