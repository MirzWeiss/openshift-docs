== Bug fixes

* Previously, when creating the `KataConfig` CR and observing the pod status under the `openshift-sandboxed-containers-operator` namespace, a huge number of restarts for monitor pods was shown. The monitor pods use a specific SELinux policy that was installed as part of the `sandboxed-containers` extension installation. The monitor pod was created immediately. However, the SELinux policy was not yet available, which resulted in a pod creation error, followed by a pod restart.
+
With this release, the SELinux policy is available when the monitor pod is created, and the monitor pod transitions to a `Running` state immediately. (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KATA-1338[*KATA-1338*])

* Previously, {sandboxed-containers-first} deployed a security context constraint (SCC) on startup which enforced a custom SELinux policy that was not available on Machine Config Operator (MCO) pods. This caused the MCO pod to change to a `CrashLoopBackOff` state and cluster upgrades to fail. With this release, {sandboxed-containers-first} deploys the SCC when creating the `KataConfig` CR and no longer enforces using the custom SELinux policy. (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KATA-1373[*KATA-1373*])

* Previously, when uninstalling the {sandboxed-containers-operator}, the `sandboxed-containers-operator-scc` custom resource was not deleted. With this release, the `sandboxed-containers-operator-scc` custom resource is deleted when uninstalling the {sandboxed-containers-operator}. (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KATA-1569[*KATA-1569*])
