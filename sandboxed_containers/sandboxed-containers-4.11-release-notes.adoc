=== Container ID in metrics list

The `sandbox_id` with the ID of the relevant sandboxed container now appears in the metrics list on the *Metrics* page in the web console.

In addition, the `kata-monitor` process now adds three new labels to kata-specific metrics: `cri_uid`, `cri_name`, and `cri_namespace`. These labels enable kata-specific metrics to relate to corresponding kubernetes workloads.
