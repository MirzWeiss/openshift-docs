toc::[]

Operators integrate with Kubernetes APIs and CLI tools such as `kubectl` and `oc`. Operators provide the means to manage applications and their resources, such as deploying a database or message bus. To minimize the footprint of {product-title}, Operators are installed directly with manifests instead of through the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).

Operators offer a more granular configuration experience. You configure each component by modifying the API that the Operator exposes instead of modifying a global configuration file. {product-title} applications are generally deployed in static environments, but Operators are available for you to use.
